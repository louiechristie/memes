        A always thought this bit of video from Tony Robbins was good at
        illustrating time management.

      <p>
        The main takeaway from Robbins: time management is actually all about
        using emotion, focus on some goal in the future that will make you
        happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of the video is delightfully cheesy 1980s, and Robbins at times
        looks like 80‚Äôs Christian Bale in American Psycho.

          <strong>Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong>: Tony Robbins does not have all the
          answers, a lot of self-help is bollocks.

        investment advice.

      <h2>Also on time management</h2>

      <p>
        I see the NHS are recommending the time matrix thing, as created by
        President Eisenhower and publicised in the book The Seven Habits of
        Highly Effective People - focus on the things that are
        <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/time-management-tips/">
          not urgent but important
        </a>{" "}
        - so that's not self help bollocks.
