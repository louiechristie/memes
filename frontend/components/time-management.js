        A always thought this bit of video from Tony Robbins was good at
        illustrating time management.

      <p>
        The main takeaway from Robbins: time management is actually all about
        using emotion, focus on some goal in the future that will make you
        happy.

      <p>
        I see the NHS are recommending the time matrix thing, as created by
        President Eisenhower and publicised in the book The Seven Habits of
        Highly Effective People - focus on the things that are{" "}

          not urgent but important
